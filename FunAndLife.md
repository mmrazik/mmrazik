# About me (outside of work)
[A picture is worth a thousand words](https://photos.app.goo.gl/YFPaCFqeY1LcMkzF8) :)

I am a father of two girls (6 and 10 years old in 2019) so a lot of my non-work
time is around family, our dog (a blue merle smooth collie) and two turtles. I
think the photos above will give some clue on what we enjoy together and how we
spend our time :)

When it comes to me specifically:
* I used to play trombone with [Big Bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_band) being mostly my thing.

* I am a big Jazz fan. What I listen to changes over time but mostly prefer "contemporary"
  musicians. Brad Mehldau, Chick Cora, Pat Metheny, Victor Wooten, Marcus Miller are some names that
  come to mind quickly. I am heavily into brass (trumpet/trombone players) and big bands like
  [Gordon Goodwin's](http://www.bigphatband.com/) or [Dave
  Holland's](https://daveholland.com/recording/ssc3028-dave-holland-big-band-overtime). The
  professionalism of these people inspire me beyond music.

* I was avoiding sport until I was ~30 year old but then I accidentally ran into triathlon and got
  hooked. Swim, bike, run is something I do a lot these days (up to 15h of training/week). Primarily
  training for [1/2 Ironman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_70.3) distance races with my
  personal best of 4:37:30 (31:57/2:21:31/1:39:42 being the swim/bike/run splits). There is
  something difficult to explain about triathlon that makes you often ask "why am I doing this"
  (at 6am with feet in cold water/swimming pool before you jump in) but then you do it again and again.
